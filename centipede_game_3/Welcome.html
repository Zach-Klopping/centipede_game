<p>
    This is an experiment in group decision making, and you will be paid for your participation in cash,
    at the end of the experiment. Different subjects may earn different amounts.
    What you earn depends partly on your decisions, partly on the decisions of others, and partly on chance.
</p>

<p>
    You and the other participants will be divided into two groups.
    The groups will be labeled the <font style="color:red;">RED</font> group and the <font style="color:blue;">BLUE</font> group.
    Your group/color will be randomly determined at the beginning of the experiment.
